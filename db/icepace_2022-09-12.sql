But more importantly than that, I like Mario Kart.\n\nLet\'s talk more about coding! My favourite part of coding is the backend of the frontend, so like React for example.

Welcome to my Icepace.\n\nI used to work in hospitality and I was very good at it, but now I am embarking on a new career as a software developer, and loving it so far! I quite like JavaScript and React. The best part of coding is that throughout the day I can listen to a lot of music.\n\nSpeaking of music, one of my favourite things is music. My top 10 albums of all time are Dark Side of the Moon, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Random Access Memories, Lemonade, and Blonde. Last time I moved house I had to hire an extra lorry just for my vinyls. I am always taking recommendations and enriching my Spotify library which consists of hundreds of thousands of albums. I am ranked number 7 on the last.fm leaderboard.\n\nI also love pokemon and I have a collection of pokemon socks which always make me feel better on a hard day of coding!\n','george.png'),

Hold on, I need to open iMessage on my iPhone. Hold on, I need to AirDrop my MeMoji to my MacBook. Hold on, I need to use FaceID to unlock Apple Pay on my iPad Mini.

Coding is super interesting and it\'s going well so far!\n\nI like to dedicate many hours every day to developing my DnD campaign. My main elf is a level 18 mage who has many other skills such as level 45 archery, level 33 accounting and level 89 dentistry. He has a 4 bed 3 bath house with underfloor heating. All these assets make him very good at winning DnD games (the rules of the game are very complicated, you wouldn\'t understand).','josh.png'),

I care a lot about the environment and about making the world a better place for everyone.\n\nWhen it comes to coding, I\'m more of a backend guy, but I have been known to dedicate many hours to CSS styling for the greater benefit of the team. I look forward to coding more code in the near future, hopefully less CSS!\n\n','mike.png'),

I would climb every day if I could! Sometimes I go to the Academy five minutes early just so I can climb into the window instead of walking in from the normal entrance. Luckily Rayna hasn\'t caught me so far!\n\nI love making pictures with DALL-E and I\'ve become quite good at giving it just the right instructions to get exactly the images I want. For example, my avatar photo is one I generated from DALL-E using the prompt: \"penguin doing rock climbing with a helmet photorealistic\". Isn\'t it cool!','harry.png');
